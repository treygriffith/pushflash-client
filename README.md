Production
----------

To use the pushflash-client in production, you can `require` it with [browserify](http://browserify.org) as part of your build, or build it from the command line with browserify.

For the CSS, use one of the css files from [humane.js](https://github.com/wavded/humane-js/tree/master/themes).
